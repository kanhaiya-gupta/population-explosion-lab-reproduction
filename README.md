Reproductive Technology Population Model

This repository contains a theoretical model exploring the impact of advanced reproductive technologies, such as artificial wombs and hormone-induced ovulation, on human population growth. The project simulates population expansion starting with two couples over 80 years, considering minimum (12 eggs/female/year) and maximum (120 eggs/female/year) scenarios.

Overview





Model: Projects population growth from 4 individuals to billions, trillions, or quintillions, depending on egg production rates.



Purpose: To highlight the potential scale of population changes and inform policy and ethical discussions.



Date: Developed as of July 2025.

Contents





data/: Raw data files (e.g., population_data.csv) with simulation results.



code/: Python scripts for the population growth model.



docs/: Article sections (e.g., Abstract.md, Introduction.md) and Figure 1 (figure1.png).



LICENSE: Open-source license for usage.

How to Use





Clone the repository: git clone <repository-URL>.



Explore the data in data/ and run the code in code/ with Python 3.x.
